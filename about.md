I am a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I'm part of the Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MINDS) group at USC's Information Sciences Institute, advised by Greg Ver Steeg and Aram Galstyan. 

I'm primarily interested in information theory, and how it can be combined with machine learning to tackle problems in pattern recogniton, causal discovery, and information flow in large networks.
