I study how concepts from information theory, such as reliable communication and compression, are manifest in information processing systems (biological/artifical neural networks). The goal of this work is to build tools that help us better understand the intermediate logic in these systems, and to leverage this understanding in the design of new tools/algorithms.

I am currently a fifth year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I'm part of the Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MINDS) group at USC's Information Sciences Institute, advised by Greg Ver Steeg and Aram Galstyan.
